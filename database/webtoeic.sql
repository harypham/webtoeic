Bạn đã biết gì về thì này rồi, cùng anh ngữ Ms Hoa tìm hiểu thêm bạn nhé**\n\nSau bài học trước về thì hiện tại đơn, hôm nay chúng ta tiếp tục học thì hiện tại hoàn thành (Present Perfect) – đây là thì tiếng Anh mà rất nhiều bạn nhầm lẫn cách sử dụng. Vì vậy, trong bài học kiến thức ngữ pháp cơ bản thì hiện tại hoàn thành, cô sẽ chia sẻ đầy đủ cho các bạn cấu trúc, cách sử dụng, dấu hiệu nhận biết và bài tập củng cố rèn luyện. Trong từng cách sử dụng cô sẽ bổ sung cả mẹo nhận biết và lưu ý những trường hợp đặc biệt để các bạn học đầy đủ và hiểu kiến thức thì hiện tại hoàn thành chi tiết nhất.\n\n![](https://www.anhngumshoa.com//uploads/images/userfiles/thi_hien_tai_hoan_thanh.JPG)\n\n**I. KHÁI NIỆM**\nThì hiện tại hoàn thành dùng để diễn tả về một hành động đã hoàn thành cho tới thời điểm hiện tại mà không bàn về thời gian diễn ra nó. \n**Câu khẳng định:**\nS + have/ has + PII.\n\nCHÚ Ý:\n\n– S = I/ We/ You/ They + have\n\n– S = He/ She/ It + has\n\nVí dụ:\n\n–  I have graduated from my university since 2012. (Tôi tốt nghiệp đại học từ năm 2012.)\n\n– We have worked for this company for 4 years. (Chúng tôi làm việc cho công ty này 4 năm rồi.)\n\n- She has started the assignment. ( Cô ấy đã bắt đầu với nhiệm vụ.)\n\n**Câu phủ định**\nS + haven’t/ hasn’t + PII.\n\nCHÚ Ý:\n\n– haven’t = have not\n\n– hasn’t = has not\n\nVí dụ:\n\n– We haven’t met each other for a long time.(Chúng tôi không gặp nhau trong một thời gian dài rồi.)\n\n–  Daniel hasn’t come back his hometown since 2015. (Daniel không quay trở lại quê hương của mình từ năm 2015.)\n\n- I haven’t started the assignment (Tôi chưa bắt đầu với nhiệm vụ)\n\n**Câu nghi vấn**\nQ: Have/Has + S + PII?\nA: Yes, S + have/ has.\n      No, S + haven\'t / hasn\'t.\n\nVí dụ:\n\nHave you ever travelled to Vietnam? (Bạn đã từng du lịch tới Việt Nam bao giờ chưa?)\n\nYes, I have./ No, I haven’t.\n\n– Has she arrived London yet? (Cô ấy đã tới Luân Đôn chưa?)\n\nYes, she has./ No, she hasn’t.\n\n- Have you started the assignment? (Bạn đã bắt đầu với công việc, nhiệm vụ\n\n**III. CÁCH SỬ DỤNG THÌ HIỆN TẠI HOÀN THÀNH**\n➣ Hành động đã hoàn thành cho tới thời điểm hiện tại mà không đề cập tới nó xảy ra khi nào.\nE.g.: I’ve done all my homework. / Tôi đã làm hết bài tập về nhà.\n\n➣Hành động bắt đầu ở quá khứ và đang tiếp tục ở hiện tại.\n\nE.g. 1:  They’ve been married for nearly fifty years. (Họ đã kết hôn được 50 năm.)\n\nE.g. 2: She has lived in Tokyo all her life. (Cố ấy đã sống cả đời ở Liverpool.)\n\n Lưu ý : Chúng ta có thể sử dụng Thì hiện tại hoàn thành tiếp diễn cho những trường hợp như ví dụ 2.\n\nE.g.:\n\nShe has been living in Tokyo all her life.\nIt’s been raining for hours.\n➣ Diễn tả hành động đã từng làm trước đây và bây giờ vẫn còn làm\n\nE.g.:\n\nHe has written three books and he is working on another book.( Anh ấy đã viết được 3 cuốn sách và đang viết cuốn tiếp theo.)\n\nI’ve played the guitar ever since I was a teenager.( Tôi đã chơi guitar kể từ khi còn nhỏ.)\n\n➣ Chúng ta thường sử dụng một mệnh đề với “since” chỉ ra khi một cái gì đó bắt đầu trong quá khứ:\n\nThey’ve stayed with us since last week. (Họ đã ở với chúng tôi từ tuần trước.)\n\nI have worked here since I left school. ( Tôi đã làm việc ở đây kể từ khi tôi rời trường.)\n\n➣Một kinh nghiệm cho tới thời điểm hiện tại (thường dùng trạng từ ever)\n\nE.g.1: My last birthday was the worst day I’ve ever had. (Sinh nhật năm ngoái là ngày tệ nhất đời tôi.)\n\nE.g.2: Have you ever met George? Yes, but I’ve never met his wife. (Sử dụng never cho trường hợp tiêu cực)\n\n➣Về một hành động trong quá khứ nhưng quan trọng tại thời điểm nói\n\nE.g.1: I can’t get my house. I’ve lost my keys. (Tôi không thể vào nhà được. Tôi đánh mất chùm chìa khóa của mình rồi.)\n\nE.g. 2: Teresa isn’t at home. I think she has gone shopping. (Teresa không có ở nhà. Tôi nghĩ cô ấy đã đi mua sắm.)\n\nLưu ý đặc biệt: Trong một số trường hợp, ta sử dụng trạng thái quá khứ phân từ của động từ TOBE : BEEN như một dạng quá khứ phân từ của động từ GO.\n\nTrong các thì tiếng Anh, \"thì hiện tại hoàn thành\" và \"thì quá khứ đơn\" là 2 thì rất nhiều bạn dễ bị nhầm lẫn cách sử dụng. Chính vì vậy, các bạn lưu ý thật kỹ để sử dụng thì tiếng Anh thật hợp lý trong ngữ cảnh nhé!\n\n**IV. DẤU HIỆU NHẬN BIẾT**\n\n- just, recently, lately: gần đây, vừa mới\n\n - already: rồi\n\n - before: trước đây\n\n - ever: đã từng\n\n- never: chưa từng, không bao giờ\n\n - yet: chưa (dùng trong câu phủ định và câu hỏi)\n \n- for + N – quãng thời gian: trong khoảng (for a year, for a long time, …) ví dụ: for 2 months: trong vòng 2 tháng\n\n - since + N – mốc/điểm thời gian: từ khi (since 1992, since June, …)\n\n - so far = until now = up to now = up to the present: cho đến bây giờ\n\n - in/ for/ during/ over + the past/ last + thời gian: trong …. Qua ( Ví dụ: During the past 2 years: trong 2 năm qua)\n\n*** Vị trí của các trạng từ trong thì hiện tại hoàn thành:\n\n- already, never, ever, just: sau “have/ has” và đứng trước động từ phân từ II.\n\n- already: cũng có thể đứng cuối câu.\n\nE.g.: I have just come back home. (Tôi vừa mới về nhà.)\n\n- Yet: đứng cuối câu, và thường được sử dụng trong câu phủ định và nghi vấn.\n\nE.g.: She hasn’t told me about you yet. (Cô ấy vẫn chưa kể với tôi về bạn.)\n\n- so far, recently, lately, up to present, up to this moment, in/ for/ during/ over + the past/ last + thời gian: Có thể đứng đầu hoặc cuối câu.\n\nE.g.: I have seen this film recently. (Tôi xem bộ phim này gần đây.)\n\n**V.

The first conference center is located next to the Upton Insurance building downtown, and is famous for its golden windows. For three years in a row, this conference building has been the venue for important international seminars and meetings between oil companies. The second conference center is even larger than its predecessor; it has ten more floors and is roughly three times wider. Construction on the second conference center began on March 2, 2004, and was not completed until July 29, 2007. To commemorate its opening, CEO of LP, Robert Henley, is planning a huge dinner, which will take place on August 15.

I was in Milan on a business trip when the conference center was completed and I could not wait to get back and see how it looked. I agree with the general consensus that Limited Properties has created a place that is even better than the first conference center. In fact, I would like to host the 4th Annual Business Development Conference at the new facility in September. This year, representatives from Chile, Korea, China, Japan, and Australia will attend the event, and I am confident they would be impressed with the LP Grand Conference Center.
